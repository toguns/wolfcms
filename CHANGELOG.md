## New find..() methods to core's Record class

In this release we've been changing the Record class quite a bit, including introducing a new, more generic Record::find() method and adding two new default methods: findById() and findOne(). The latter two are fairly self-explanatory but with regards to the first we'd like to give a short insight:

```
// give it a path
$page = Page::find('/the/path/to/your/page');

// or an array of options...
$page = Page::find(array('where' => 'created_by_id=12'));
```
The some of the basic options that can be supplied in the array include "where", "order", "offset" and "limit" among others.

## Automatic find..By..() methods

This release introduces a BETA feature in the core's Framework that can be of interest: automatic find..By..() methods. This feature introduces a Finder class which extends Record. Developers who are tired of writing custom find..By..() methods for their models can now extend the Finder class instead of the Record class. This allows them to use find..By..() methods without writing them.

For example:

```
<?php

class MyModel extends Finder {
    public $id;
    public $email;
    public $name;
}

$obj = MyModel::findByName('Peter');
echo $obj->name;

// echo's "Peter"

// Less trivial example: find users with same name
$objects = MyModel::findIdNameEmailByNameOrderedByIdAsc('mike');
```

Simply use a non-existing find..By..() method and it'll respond. Try it out and let us know what you think! Please keep in mind that the implementation still needs some improvements, including performance, and once we start requiring PHP 5.4, this will likely switch to being a Trait.
